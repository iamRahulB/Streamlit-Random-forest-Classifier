<h1>Random Forest Classifier with Streamlit</h1>

<p>This project presents a <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong> implemented using <strong>Streamlit</strong>, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>The classifier is trained on two types of datasets: <strong>Concentric Circles</strong> and <strong>Spiral</strong> data. These datasets are particularly challenging because the decision boundaries between classes are not linear, testing the flexibility of the model.</p>

<p>A key feature of this project is the use of a <strong>meshgrid</strong>. The meshgrid allows us to visualize the decision boundaries of the classifier, providing insights into its performance and potential overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive UI</strong>: The Streamlit framework provides an interactive user interface, allowing users to input parameters and run the classifier in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable Parameters</strong>: Users can customize various parameters of the Random Forest Classifier including the number of estimators, maximum features, bootstrap option, and maximum samples.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong>: The matplotlib library is used to plot the datasets and the decision boundaries of the classifier.</li>
</ul>
