#Random Forest Classifier with Streamlit
This project presents a Random Forest Classifier implemented using Streamlit, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

#Project Description
The classifier is trained on two types of datasets: Concentric Circles and Spiral data. These datasets are particularly challenging because the decision boundaries between classes are not linear, testing the flexibility of the model.

A key feature of this project is the use of a meshgrid. The meshgrid allows us to visualize the decision boundaries of the classifier, providing insights into its performance and potential overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.

#Features
Interactive UI: The Streamlit framework provides an interactive user interface, allowing users to input parameters and run the classifier in real-time.
Customizable Parameters: Users can customize various parameters of the Random Forest Classifier including the number of estimators, maximum features, bootstrap option, and maximum samples.
Visualization: The matplotlib library is used to plot the datasets and the decision boundaries of the classifier.
